///// [Fibonacci Numbers]

The Fibonacci numbers are very useful for introducing algorithms, so before we continue, here is a short introduction to Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci numbers are named after a 13th century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci.

The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers, so we get 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

///// [Finding The nth Fibonacci Number Using Recursion]

To find the nth Fibonacci number we can write code based on the mathematic formula for Fibonacci number n

F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

This just means that for example the 10th Fibonacci number is the sum of the 9th and 8th Fibonacci numbers.

Note: This formula uses a 0-based index. This means that to generate the 20th Fibonacci number, we must write F(19)

[Notice] :that this recursive method calls itself two times, not just one. 
This makes a huge difference in how the program will actually run on our computer. 
The number of calculations will explode when we increase the number of the Fibonacci number we want. 
To be more precise, the number of function calls will double every time we increase the Fibonacci number we want by one.
